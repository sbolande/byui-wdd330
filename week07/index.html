                <li>Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell.</li>
                <li>The <code>fetch()</code> method returns a promise that resolves to the response returned from the URL that was provided as an argument, but should also include a catch statement to deal with any errors that may occur on promise rejection.</li>
                <li>Any response between 200 and 299 is considered "ok" on the response object.</li>
                <li>The <code>redirect()</code> method, while not supported in any browser, could be used to create a new promise that resolves to the response form the redirected url.</li>
                <li>Text, File, and JSON responses can all come back on AJAX, but JSON is the most common format.</li>
